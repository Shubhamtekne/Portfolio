# Portfolio
Portfolio site (vibe coded) — React, Tailwind, Framer Motion. Includes a demo-only admin panel UI; no real backend/DB yet.
# Shubham Tekne — Portfolio

Personal portfolio website built with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.

## About This Project

This portfolio was built using **vibe coding** — I used AI assistance to generate a lot of the code,
and I'm learning the underlying concepts (React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion) as I go, rather than
having hand-written every line myself.

This is a **frontend-only project** — there is no real backend or database connected anywhere.

The site includes an **Admin section** (Login, Dashboard) which is a **UI/frontend demo only** —
it is not connected to any real authentication service or database, and doesn't persist real data.
It exists so I could practice building admin-style interfaces (protected routes, context-based auth
state, dashboard layouts).

I'm an MCA student focused primarily on **Java + Spring Boot backend development**, but I'm genuinely
interested in becoming a full-stack developer — this project is part of that learning path.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite 8
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Animations:** Framer Motion 12
- **State:** React Query + Zustand-ready architecture
- **SEO:** react-helmet-async + JSON-LD structured data
- **PWA:** Service Worker + manifest.json
- **Icons:** lucide-react
- **Build:** Code-splitting, lazy loading, CSS minification

## Design System

All reusable UI components live in `src/components/ui/`:

| Component     | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Button`      | Variants: primary, secondary, ghost, danger. Sizes: sm, md, lg. Supports loading, icons, href. |
| `Card`        | Animated surface card with optional hover lift. |
| `Badge`       | Small status labels. Variants: default, accent, success, warning. |
| `Skeleton`    | Loading placeholders. Variants: text, title, card, button, avatar. |
| `SkeletonCard`| Full card skeleton for project load states. |
| `SectionHeading` | Consistent section headers with label, title, description. |
| `Terminal`    | Retro terminal window frame. |
| `CommandPalette` | Ctrl+K modal with search + Vercel-like commands. |

## Features

### ✅ Completed
- **Dark/Light theme** — persisted in localStorage, respects system preference
- **Command palette** — Ctrl+K, search all content, Vercel-style commands
- **Global search** — searches projects, skills, sections, experience
- **CMS-driven content** — edit `src/content/profile.js` to update everything
- **Code splitting** — manual chunks for React, Framer, Lucide, React Query
- **Lazy loading** — App component is lazy-loaded
- **Error boundary** — catches render errors with recovery UI
- **SEO** — meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD Schema.org
- **PWA** — service worker for offline support, manifest.json
- **Security** — meta-equivalent security headers, noopener/noreferrer on external links
- **Accessibility** — skip-to-content link, ARIA labels, keyboard nav, semantic HTML
- **Tailwind integration** — dark mode via `class` strategy
- **Animation library** — centralized `src/lib/animations.js`
- **Reusable hooks** — `useScrollPosition`, `useMediaQuery`
- **Responsive** — mobile, tablet, desktop, ultra-wide
- **Reduced motion** — respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Loading skeletons** — skeleton components for async content

### 🔄 In Progress / Planned

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

Build output is in `dist/`. Deploy to any static host:

### Vercel
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
